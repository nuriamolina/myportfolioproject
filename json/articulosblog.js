            "texto":"A kitchen decked out with forest-green plywood cabinets and a shelving unit filled with plants add colour to this otherwise simple apartment in Ukrainian city Lviv, by interior designer Roman Shpelyk. Apartment #149 is the home of a young couple, who asked Shpelyk for an inexpensive overhaul of their living spaces, to make it feel roomy. The clients knew our style and approach, the designer told Dezeen. Usability and low budget were the main criteria we had to deal with. Shpelyk and his team refrained from creating closed off rooms, so that the apartment appears more spacious. They left many surfaces in their natural condition, and employed cheap materials to create any new additions. Concrete columns retain all their original lumps and indents, while new walls have been created using inexpensive blockwork.The only flashes of colour come from the new kitchen and the plant-covered partition. The kitchen features laminated plywood cabinetry, coloured in a shade of forest green, which Shpelyk says creates a delicate accent and revives the interior with colour.It is a technique that has also recently been used on a home in London, which features a yellow kitchen, and a Porto flat, which has a blue kitchen. The materials we used in this project gave us the opportunity to create interesting texture contrasts, which enriched the interior visually he said. We were trying various combinations and finally chose green, as the clients liked that colour. Similarly, the plant-covered shelving unit creates a see-through partition between between the bedroom and the main living spaces – and echoes the hue of the kitchen, located just opposite. Lined with potted plants, it offers some privacy for the bedroom area, but doesn't close it off completely. The bed is slightly raised up on a platform to offer further separation. The room also features a small workspace, provided by a birch plywood desk slotted beneath a window. I would say its quite fascinating to think over every meter of the apartment and how it will be used, said Shpelyk. In small apartments you have to think of every detail. Other details include black furnishings and an ash wood floor. We adore this type of wood, added Shpelyk.There is also storage space for bicycles, provided by hooks attached to the walls.",

            "titulo":"Atelier Barda renovates Montreal apartment with minimalist finishes and custom furniture",
            "imagenprincipal":"/img/blogimg/2.jpg",
            "texto":"Montreal architecture studio Atelier Barda has renovated a loft apartment in the city's trendy Mile End neighbourhood, stripping down its interiors to replace them using bespoke finishes and filling the spaces with custom furniture. An undisclosed company in the fashion industry commissioned Atelier Barda to create a space to host their international clients and collaborators when they visit the city. Named after the street on which it is located, the Saint-Laurent Apartment is described by the firm as a cross between a hotel room and loft apartment. Encompassing 1,150 square feet (107 square metres), the home has an open-plan configuration for the kitchen, living and dining room, while the bedroom, bathroom, and dressing room are kept separate. The layout of the apartment was reconfigured to optimise the rooms and allow fluid, discreet circulation between the bedroom, dressing room and bathroom, said the architects. The freed-up space was used to create a large open living room, bathed in natural light. The large living area allows plenty of space for entertaining guests. It contains a kitchen with black-stained oak cabinets, which complement pale marble countertops and backsplashes. Leaving the building's original structure exposed allowed the architects to highlight their interventions. The original structure was deliberately left visible, the crude quality of the existing frame contrasting with the careful treatment of interior details and materials, the team said. Minimalist furniture designed for the apartment includes the kitchen table and bench, made of wood and steel, and two puffy leather couches within the living room separated by an oversized coffee table. A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf runs along an entire wall of the living room, holding plants and other home objects. It stands across the room from a low marble bench. Together, these elements frame the main living space.",

            "imagenprincipal":"/img/blogimg/3.jpg",
            "texto":"New York design studio New Affiliates has placed a plywood sleeping platform between chunky columns at an apartment in Brooklyn, making the most of the building's high ceilings. The overhauled home takes up 750 square feet (70 square metres) of a former industrial space in the increasingly trendy neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, often shortened to Bed-Stuy. New Affiliates renovated the Bed-Stuy Loft using unfinished materials to retain the original atmosphere, with exposed steel, raw plywood and metal-mesh panels used to partition areas for different activities. The most prominent intervention is a mezzanine level, providing a sleeping area on top and a workspace underneath. This structure is clad in plywood with a distinct gradient, which also runs across the doors of cupboards in the adjacent kitchen. The bedroom is accessed via a open-tread staircase tucked at the back of the box-like volume, facing the compact bathroom. White mesh wraps around the upper level to form a barrier for safety and privacy, for both the bed and a slightly raised dressing area. Two thick cylindrical columns that splay outwards at their tops sit along a central axis. A corner of the mezzanine is cut out to avoid one, while the other is incorporated into the kitchen island. The added elements playfully interact with two large existing columns positioned near the edge of the space, which serve as a terminating boundary for the design, said New Affiliates, which is led by Ivi Diamantopoulou and Jaffer Kolb. Their architectural intervention either keeps an intimate gap that mimics the outline of the column, or hugs it. Cupboards in the island are fronted with green lacquer, and copper pipes extend down from the ceiling to the sink cut into the horizontal surface. All of these elements are squeezed into one half of the apartment, leaving a tall space near the windows for a spacious living area. Many Brooklyn residents are opting to upgrade their homes rather than move, with recently completed projects including an interior overhauled to include hiding places for cats, and a row house extended with a rooftop bedroom suite.",

            "titulo":"Parking garage extension forms home for architects Ensamble",
            "imagenprincipal":"/img/blogimg/4.jpg",
            "texto":"To build their own home in the Massachusetts town of Brookline, the principals of Spanish firm Ensamble Studio prefabricated individual parts of the structure in Madrid and sailed them across the Atlantic to be assembled on site. Although usually based in the Spanish capital, Ensamble founders Débora Mesa and Antón García-Abril conduct research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, USA. They therefore needed a secondary residence close to the university, so decided to create one for themselves. The result is Cyclopean House, which was completed in 2015. A decommissioned parking garage serves as the base of the home, in which the architects have installed a workshop, parking, and utility spaces. Their intervention is an extension upwards, which accommodates the family's living spaces within a 240-square-metre box. The gloomy construction is completed with the big room built on it by the assembly of the large prefabricated elements that rest after their long transatlantic voyage, said a statement from Ensamble, which Mesa and García-Abril founded in 2000. Prefabricated metal trusses form the living space above the garage, which has a flexible, open-concept layout. This open-plan double-height living area includes the main domestic activities and enables the transformation of the residual building into a two-story residential unit, the architects said. Furniture and other amenities were tucked into spaces that match the depth of the structural beams. On the western facade, the architects tucked away a kitchen nook, bathroom and storage spaces. To the south, a pull-out bed and wardrobes were also hidden away within the thick walls. The north and eastern sides of the square plan are occupied by bright red couches, which can accommodate guests if necessary. A flight of metallic stairs with a glass guardrail leads up to a mezzanine overlooking the entire space. Expansive windows on this level bring light into the house, while maintaining some privacy for the open-plan configuration. The rest of the plan is cleared to be shared by different events succeeding in time, and functions have the option to expand into the central space as needed, determining its temporary layout, said Ensamble. A rooftop deck allows the residents to enjoy an elevated view of the surrounding neighbourhood. A wall on the side of the terrace facing the street partially cuts off the space. However, the other three sides of the square are protected by a simple chain-link fence, which can be seen through easily. The architects envision this construction system as a rapid and effective way of building. The beams that form the walls of the house are mostly comprised of insulation, making them very light. Furthermore, their size makes it possible to deliver them to a job site ready-made, potentially saving on resources for construction. Dry joints and material lightness enable the different elements to be produced out of site, including finishes and fixtures, the studio said. These are easily transported by ship and regular trucks and quickly placed together following a rhythmic sequence that is carefully planned beforehand. Last year, Ensamble completed several monumental interventions at the newly opened Tippet Rise Arts Center in Montana. More recently, they were invited to participate in the Chicago Architecture Biennial's reinterpretation of the 1922 Chicago Tribune skyscraper competition.",

            "imagenprincipal":"/img/blogimg/5.jpg",
            "texto":"Studio 1 Architects has added a brick extension with a large window to the rear of this Victorian house in London, creating a light-filled seating area lined in white-washed ash slats. The local studio reconfigured and extended the ground floor of the Gladstone Road property in south-west London, aiming to create living spaces with views and access into garden. It forms part of a wider refurbishment of the residence, which included stripping out interior walls and floors, and adding a loft extension for a new master bedroom and additional bathroomInside this unassuming Victorian House is a unique, contemporary total refurbishment with additional rear and roof extensions, said the architects. Seamless skylights, concrete floors, exposed brickwork, projecting glass box, whitewashed ash slats and oak ribs create an enthralling new take on a period house, they added. On the ground floor, a long skylight separates the existing property from a one-storey brick structure occupied by a built-in seating area. A large window that cantilevers towards the garden with thin black frames. Seating is built in below the large window, while slats of white-washed ash line the walls and wrap up over the ceiling. A protruding glass box cantilevers over the garden, explained the architects. This box is frameless and provides a close connection to the garden when sitting in the built in seating area. Ash timber slats create zoning of the sitting area and wrap up and over the ceiling, they added.These disappear into a seamless skylight. The architects also removed the side wall at the back of property. An oak rib structure and glazing slots between the existing residence and a new brick wall, creating space for a dining area. The seasoned oak ribs function both structurally and aesthetically, and provide a slatted light effect over the dining area, they said. A long bench runs along the the brick wall towards the end where a set of glass doors open to the garden. Also in this space, the kitchen features a central white island and low wall cabinets. Dark-grey upper cabinets complement the concrete flooring and cushions for the seating. The addition of a mansard roof creates a high space for the new bedroom, where strips of lighting feature along the ridge and behind the chimney breast. Colourful accents, including orange lamps and brightly coloured artwork, offset the simple finishes of white-painted walls and light grey carpeting. A full-width skylight tops the new bathroom so that the residents can see the sky and stars when bathing. A growing thirst for contemporary design has triggered a spate of extensions to London homes.",

            "titulo":"New app Smartify functions as 'a Shazam for the art world'",
            "imagenprincipal":"/img/blogimg/6.jpg",
            "texto":"An app has launched that allows users to instantly identify artworks and access information about them, by simply scanning them with a smartphone. Smartify launched at the Royal Academy of Arts in London last week. It has been described by its creators as a Shazam for the art world, because – like the app that can identify any music track – it can reveal the title and artist of thousands of artworks. It does so by cross-referencing them with a vast database that the company is constantly updating. Smartify is already in use in over 30 of the world's major galleries and museums, including the National Gallery in London, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Met in New York and LACMA in Los Angeles. The company refuses to reveal exactly how it works, but said that it creates visual fingerprints to differentiate between each artwork. We scan artworks using photos or digital images and then create digital fingerprints of the artwork, meaning that it is reduced to a set of digital dots and lines, explained co-founder Anna Lowe. When a user tries the app against an artwork, the app analyses the target artwork and matches it against existing images we have scanned. The app provides users with detailed information about the piece they're looking at, as well as recorded interviews with the artist. The aim is to offer a more human story, rather than the dry descriptions typical of audio guides and catalogues. Lowe described it as like an enthusiastic and knowledgeable friend telling you more about a work of art. Our team has always loved visiting museums and galleries, and seeing art. We found that we developed a much deeper understanding and connection with an artwork when we learned stories about it and its context, she told Dezeen. The app currently doesn't recognise artworks that are not stored on its database, but the company hopes to change this in the future. Smartify has also collaborated with nonprofit organisation, the Wikimedia Foundation, to utilise Wikipedia's image gallery, helping it to increase the efficacy of its image recognition technology. Users can save their favourite artworks and share them with Smartify's online community. The app uses these favourites to recommend other pieces it thinks the user might like. The company hope that project will reframe the use of smartphones in galleries, as objects for engagement rather than disruption. We want to provide information in the most elegant, accessible and unobtrusive way possible, Lowe said. As a social enterprise, we hope the app will encourage more people to think visual art, and visiting museums and galleries is 'for them', and also support public museums and artists in engaging differently with existing audiences and reaching new ones, she added. Other apps that help users identify things in their environment include one launched by the Architecture Foundation in London that maps the location of over 1,100 historic and contemporary buildings.

            "texto":"This exclusive clip gives a preview of the new design documentary series Abstract: The Art of Design, which will bring Bjarke Ingels, Es Devlin, Ilse Crawford and more into the living rooms of Netflix's global audience. Launching internationally tomorrow, Friday 10 February, the series profiles eight designers representing different fields in the industry. Along with Ingels, Devlin and Crawford from the fields of architecture, stage design and interior design respectively, there's graphic designer Paula Scher, automobile designer Ralph Gilles, Nike shoe designer Tinker Hatfield, illustrator Christoph Niemann and photographer Platon. The series is exclusive to the Netflix streaming service, which reaches an audience of more than 93 million members in over 190 countries. Following in the footsteps of Netflix's ongoing docu-series The Chef's Table, Abstract: The Art of Design will focus on a different designer. The episodes are helmed by different directors – including the likes of Morgan Neville, who was behind the Academy Award-winning music documentary 20 Feet From Stardom – and take different storytelling and aesthetic approaches. The eight episodes will be released collectively on Friday, 10 February. Ingels' episode was filmed in the lead-up to the installation of his Serpentine Pavilion. In it, the Danish architect talks about how BIG has changed perception of what architecture should be like. The episode following Scher, a partner at Pentagram, explores how her typography has shaped the face of New York, as well as some of the iconic album covers of the 1970s. Another episode traces Hatfield's career at Nike, showing how he came to design some of the sports brand's most famous shoes – including the nearly ill-fated Air Max. Other episodes focus on the achievements and creative processes of Crawford, Gilles, Devlin, Niemann and Platon. The series is produced by Neville alongside Wired's departing editor-in-chief Scott Dadich, Dave O'Conner, Justin Wilkes, Jon Kamen and Radical Media",

            "titulo":"Dropbox criticised for colourful new visual identity",
            "imagenprincipal":"/img/blogimg/8.jpg",
            "texto":"Dropbox has rebranded to promote itself as a creative platform rather than simply a file-sharing service – but the design has attracted criticism for its use of clashing colours. The California-based file-hosting website worked with New York agency Collins to design its new visual identity, described as the biggest change to the company's image in its 10-year history. The design is based around a simplified version of the old logo, designed to look more like a collection of platforms rather than a literal box, to show that Dropbox is an open platform, and a place for creation. This logo comes in a vibrant spectrum of shades, as well as the original blue and white, and users are encouraged to choose which colour combination they prefer, to customise their interface. This change has prompted a outpouring of criticism on Twitter, with one user describing the experience as making him feel colour blind. Whoever came up with this horrid icon colour update? asked another user, while others shared images of flashing colours to express their dislike. According to Dropbox creative director Aaron Robbs and vice president of design Nicholas Jitkoff, the redesign is intended to show that the Dropbox is a living workspace that brings teams and ideas together. Our new design system is built on the idea that extraordinary things happen when diverse minds come together, they said. We communicate this visually by pairing contrasting colours, type, and imagery to show what's possible when we bring ideas together in unexpected ways. Our new system lets us pick the right amount of expressiveness for the situation, they added. Colour can go from a standard Dropbox blue to ‘whoa'. As well as the new logo and colour schemes, the visual identity includes a change in typography. Collins chose Sharp Grotesk, which includes 250 different fonts, to offer the brand more versatility. The rebrand also includes a series of playful illustrations, which will accompany notifications on the website. For the campaign, these were used to create a 60-second film that asks: What does creative energy mean?

            "imagenprincipal":"/img/blogimg/9.jpg",
            "texto":"Pentagram partner Dominic Lippa has produced his 11th consecutive identity for the London Design Festival, using red neon letters.Taking influence from the uniqueness of London's unlikely urban beauty, this year's identity is designed to create a feeling of immediacy and scale. Real, manufactured signs were commissioned and handmade by a bespoke sign maker – a first for Pentagram. The festival's identity, which will be physically produced for the event, expresses neon's playfulness as well as its architectural and 3D qualities, Lippa told Dezeen. This year we have based the entire identity around imagery, as opposed to our previous graphic or typographic approach. As with previous years, the identity follows a largely restricted colour palette of red and white. This is to keep consistency with the festival's branding over the years, and to evoke a sense of directness and urgency aimed at reflecting London's feeling. Pentagram worked with photographer John Ross to create imagery of the signs, capturing the neon tubes at a variety of angles. Zoomed-in pictures form more abstract backdrops for text and information, while zoomed-out photos show the logo as a whole. We really attempted to stretch the legibility of the sign — exploring various shapes, angles and expressions — with the aim of conveying the festival's commitment to approaching design from unique directions, Lippa said. I have known and worked with John for over 35 years and apart from him being a friend, he continued,I think he's one of the best photographers in London and totally understood what we were after and stretched the legibility of the sign to the point the image becomes sculptural. The identity for the festival will be applied to promotional materials, including the official guide, posters, signage, merchandise and advertising. Pentagram is one of the world's largest graphics and branding agencies, which was set up in London in 1972 and now has offices across the globe. Recent projects by its various arms and partners include an album cover for The National, the branding for the School of Architecture at Taliesin, and a visual identity for an organisation lobbying against tampon tax.London Design Festival takes place 16 to 24 September 2017 across the city. Among the installations to visit during the week are an inflatable castle behind Liverpool Street Station by Camille Walala and a colourful hall of light at the V&A museum by Flynn Talbot.",

            "texto":"Multicoloured slippers and T-shirts decorated with Wire chair prints feature in Uniqlo's new collection, which is dedicated to American design couple Charles and Ray Eames. With its Sprz NY Eames collection, the Japanese high street brand wanted to celebrate the contribution designers Ray and Charles Eames made to 20th century design, architecture and culture. Unisex garments, including T-shirts, blankets and slippers, are each decorated with pieces of Eames-designed furniture, or patterns reminiscent of their style. Among the most influential designers of the 20th century, Charles and Ray Eames transformed how people experienced and observed the world through furniture, architecture, public spaces, and films, said Uniqlo, which worked alongside the Eames Office to produce the collection. Like Uniqlo, Charles and Ray believed that good design and quality objects should be available to all, the brand continued. This belief underpinned their work with innovative materials to celebrate the uncommon beauty of common things and to uplift people in their everyday lives. Some of the Eames' most famous chair designs feature on one T-shirt, in a print that sees the likes of the Wire, lounge and plastic chairs arranged in a circle. Another T-shirt depicts a group of Wire chairs – designed by the duo in the 1950s – while a further has multicoloured drawings of the lounge chair spread across the chest. As well as literal depictions of iconic furniture pieces, the collection includes garments pattered with the Eames' textile designs. Women's shawls are decorated with both the Dot Pattern, designed by Ray in 1949, and the Circles print – which she created for a 1947 textile competition at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The collection is the latest in Uniqlo's Sprz NY (short for Surprise New York) collection, which sees items designed in celebration of influential artists and designers. Those featured in the past have included Andy Warhol, Corita Kent, and Keith Haring. The full collection will be available to purchase online from 12 October 2017, and in selected stores the following day. Charles and Ray Eames are considered to be two of the most influential designers of the 20th century, having produced some of the most famous furniture pieces in modern design history. But the late designers' works are also some of the most widely replicated. Last year, Dezeen reported that discount supermarket chain Aldi was selling pairs of replica DSW Eames Plastic Chairs for £39.99 – a fraction of the £339 it costs to buy a single authorised version by Vitra.",
