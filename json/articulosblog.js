            "texto":"A kitchen decked out with forest-green plywood cabinets and a shelving unit filled with plants add colour to this otherwise simple apartment in Ukrainian city Lviv, by interior designer Roman Shpelyk. Apartment #149 is the home of a young couple, who asked Shpelyk for an inexpensive overhaul of their living spaces, to make it feel roomy. The clients knew our style and approach, the designer told Dezeen. Usability and low budget were the main criteria we had to deal with. Shpelyk and his team refrained from creating closed off rooms, so that the apartment appears more spacious. They left many surfaces in their natural condition, and employed cheap materials to create any new additions. Concrete columns retain all their original lumps and indents, while new walls have been created using inexpensive blockwork.The only flashes of colour come from the new kitchen and the plant-covered partition. The kitchen features laminated plywood cabinetry, coloured in a shade of forest green, which Shpelyk says creates a delicate accent and revives the interior with colour.It is a technique that has also recently been used on a home in London, which features a yellow kitchen, and a Porto flat, which has a blue kitchen. The materials we used in this project gave us the opportunity to create interesting texture contrasts, which enriched the interior visually he said. We were trying various combinations and finally chose green, as the clients liked that colour. Similarly, the plant-covered shelving unit creates a see-through partition between between the bedroom and the main living spaces – and echoes the hue of the kitchen, located just opposite. Lined with potted plants, it offers some privacy for the bedroom area, but doesn't close it off completely. The bed is slightly raised up on a platform to offer further separation. The room also features a small workspace, provided by a birch plywood desk slotted beneath a window. I would say its quite fascinating to think over every meter of the apartment and how it will be used, said Shpelyk. In small apartments you have to think of every detail. Other details include black furnishings and an ash wood floor. We adore this type of wood, added Shpelyk.There is also storage space for bicycles, provided by hooks attached to the walls.",

            "texto":"Montreal architecture studio Atelier Barda has renovated a loft apartment in the city's trendy Mile End neighbourhood, stripping down its interiors to replace them using bespoke finishes and filling the spaces with custom furniture. An undisclosed company in the fashion industry commissioned Atelier Barda to create a space to host their international clients and collaborators when they visit the city. Named after the street on which it is located, the Saint-Laurent Apartment is described by the firm as a cross between a hotel room and loft apartment. Encompassing 1,150 square feet (107 square metres), the home has an open-plan configuration for the kitchen, living and dining room, while the bedroom, bathroom, and dressing room are kept separate. The layout of the apartment was reconfigured to optimise the rooms and allow fluid, discreet circulation between the bedroom, dressing room and bathroom, said the architects. The freed-up space was used to create a large open living room, bathed in natural light. The large living area allows plenty of space for entertaining guests. It contains a kitchen with black-stained oak cabinets, which complement pale marble countertops and backsplashes. Leaving the building's original structure exposed allowed the architects to highlight their interventions. The original structure was deliberately left visible, the crude quality of the existing frame contrasting with the careful treatment of interior details and materials, the team said. Minimalist furniture designed for the apartment includes the kitchen table and bench, made of wood and steel, and two puffy leather couches within the living room separated by an oversized coffee table. A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf runs along an entire wall of the living room, holding plants and other home objects. It stands across the room from a low marble bench. Together, these elements frame the main living space.",

            "texto":"New York design studio New Affiliates has placed a plywood sleeping platform between chunky columns at an apartment in Brooklyn, making the most of the building's high ceilings. The overhauled home takes up 750 square feet (70 square metres) of a former industrial space in the increasingly trendy neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, often shortened to Bed-Stuy. New Affiliates renovated the Bed-Stuy Loft using unfinished materials to retain the original atmosphere, with exposed steel, raw plywood and metal-mesh panels used to partition areas for different activities. The most prominent intervention is a mezzanine level, providing a sleeping area on top and a workspace underneath. This structure is clad in plywood with a distinct gradient, which also runs across the doors of cupboards in the adjacent kitchen. The bedroom is accessed via a open-tread staircase tucked at the back of the box-like volume, facing the compact bathroom. White mesh wraps around the upper level to form a barrier for safety and privacy, for both the bed and a slightly raised dressing area. Two thick cylindrical columns that splay outwards at their tops sit along a central axis. A corner of the mezzanine is cut out to avoid one, while the other is incorporated into the kitchen island. The added elements playfully interact with two large existing columns positioned near the edge of the space, which serve as a terminating boundary for the design, said New Affiliates, which is led by Ivi Diamantopoulou and Jaffer Kolb. Their architectural intervention either keeps an intimate gap that mimics the outline of the column, or hugs it. Cupboards in the island are fronted with green lacquer, and copper pipes extend down from the ceiling to the sink cut into the horizontal surface. All of these elements are squeezed into one half of the apartment, leaving a tall space near the windows for a spacious living area. Many Brooklyn residents are opting to upgrade their homes rather than move, with recently completed projects including an interior overhauled to include hiding places for cats, and a row house extended with a rooftop bedroom suite.",
